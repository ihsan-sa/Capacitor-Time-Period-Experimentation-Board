# RC Circuit Time Period Experimentation Board

This board is a prototype for a capacitor time period experimentation board to supplement the high school Physics curriculum.
Using a potentiometer, calibrate the device to switch the LED off exactly when the time period of the RC circuit time period is reached.

This cirucit uses an Op-Amp in comparator configuration to compare the voltage of the capacitor to a threshold voltage set to 1/e times the supply voltage by the user.
